#| In this lesson, we'll discuss why graphics are an
#| important tool for data scientists and the special
#| role that exploratory graphs play in the field.

#...

#| Which of the following would NOT be a good reason
| to use graphics in data science?

#1: To understand data properties
#2: To find patterns in data
########3: To find a color that best matches the shirt you're wearing
#4: To suggest modeling strategies

#A picture is worth a 1000 words

#| Exploratory graphs serve mostly the same functions
#| as graphs. They help us find patterns in data and
#| understand its properties. They suggest modeling
#| strategies and help to debug analyses. We DON'T use
#| exploratory graphs to communicate results.

#| Instead, exploratory graphs are the initial step in
#| an investigation, the "quick and dirty" tool used
#| to point the data scientist in a fruitful
#| direction. A scientist might need to make a lot of
#| exploratory graphs in order to develop a personal
#| understanding of the problem being studied. Plot
#| details such as axes, legends, color and size are
#| cleaned up later to convey more information in an
#| aesthetically pleasing way.

#| To demonstrate these ideas, we've copied some data
#| for you from the U.S. Environmental Protection
#| Agency (EPA) which sets national ambient air
#| quality standards for outdoor air pollution. These
#| Standards say that for fine particle pollution
#| (PM2.5), the "annual mean, averaged over 3 years"
#| cannot exceed 12 micro grams per cubic meter. We
#| stored the data from the U.S. EPA web site in the
#| data frame pollution. Use the R function head to
#| see the first few entries of pollution.

#head(pollution)
#       pm25  fips region longitude latitude
#1  9.771185 01003   east -87.74826 30.59278
#2  9.993817 01027   east -85.84286 33.26581
#3 10.688618 01033   east -87.72596 34.73148
#4 11.337424 01049   east -85.79892 34.45913
#5 12.119764 01055   east -86.03212 34.01860
#6 10.827805 01069   east -85.35039 31.18973

#| We see right away that there's at least one county
#| exceeding the EPA's standard of 12 micrograms per
#| cubic meter. What else do we see?

#| We see 5 columns of data. The pollution count is in
#| the first column labeled pm25. We'll work mostly
#| with that. The other 4 columns are a fips code
#| indicating the state (first 2 digits) and county
#| (last 3 digits) with that count, the associated
#| region (east or west), and the longitude and
#| latitude of the area. Now run the R command dim
#| with pollution as an argument to see how long the
#| table is.

dim(pollution)
#[1] 576   5

#| So there are 576 entries in pollution. We'd like to
#| investigate the question "Are there any counties in
#| the U.S. that exceed that national standard (12
#| micro grams per cubic meter) for fine particle
#| pollution?" We'll look at several one dimensional
#| summaries of the data to investigate this question.

#| The first technique uses the R command summary, a
#| 5-number summary which returns 6 numbers. Run it
#| now with the pm25 column of pollution as its
#| argument. Recall that the construct for this is
#| pollution$pm25.

summary(pollution$pm25)
#   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
#  3.383   8.549  10.050   9.836  11.360  18.440 


#| This shows us basic info about the pm25 data,
#| namely its Minimum (0 percentile) and Maximum (100
#| percentile) values, and three Quartiles of the
#| data. These last indicate the pollution measures at
#| which 25%, 50%, and 75% of the counties fall below.
#| In addition to these 5 numbers we see the Mean or
#| average measure of particulate pollution across the
#| 576 counties.

#| To save you a lot of typing we've saved off
#| pollution$pm25 for you in the variable ppm. You can
#| use ppm now in place of the longer expression. Try
#| it now as the argument of the R command quantile.
#| See how the results look a lot like the results of
#| the output of the summary command.

quantile(ppm)
#       0%       25%       50%       75%      100% 
# 3.382626  8.548799 10.046697 11.356012 18.440731 

#| Now we'll plot a picture, specifically a boxplot.
#| Run the R command boxplot with ppm as an input.
#| Also specify the color parameter col equal to
#| "blue".

boxplot(ppm)

#| Not quite, but you're learning! Try again. Or, type
#| info() for more options.

#| Type boxplot(ppm,col="blue") at the command prompt.

boxplot(ppm,col="blue")


#| The boxplot shows us the same quartile data that
#| summary and quantile did. The lower and upper edges
#| of the blue box respectively show the values of the
#| 25% and 75% quantiles.

#...

#  |===========                                 |  24%

#| What do you think the horizontal line inside the
#| box represents? The MEAN.

#| The "whiskers" of the box (the vertical lines
#| extending above and below the box) relate to the
#| range parameter of boxplot, which we let default to
#| the value 1.5 used by R. The height of the box is
#| the interquartile range, the difference between the
#| 75th and 25th quantiles. In this case that
#| difference is 2.8. The whiskers are drawn to be a
#| length of range*2.8 or 1.5*2.8. This shows us
#| roughly how many, if any, data points are outliers,
#| that is, beyond this range of values.

#| Note that boxplot is part of R's base plotting
#| package. A nice feature that this package provides
#| is its ability to overlay features. That is, you
#| can add to (annotate) an existing plot.

#...

#  |============                                |  28%

#| To see this, run the R command abline with the
#| argument h equal to 12. Recall that 12 is the EPA
#| standard for air quality.

abline(h=12)

#| What do you think this command did?

#3: drew a horizontal line at 12

#| So abline "adds one or more straight lines through
#| the current plot." We see from the plot that the
#| bulk of the measured counties comply with the
#| standard since they fall under the line marking
#| that standard.

#| Now use the R command hist (another function from
#| the base package) with the argument ppm. Specify
#| the color parameter col equal to "green". This will
#| plot a histogram of the data.

#| The histogram gives us a little more detailed
#| information about our data, specifically the
#| distribution of the pollution counts, or how many
#| counties fall into each bucket of measurements.

#...

 # |===============                             |  35%

#Now run the R command rug with the argument ppm.

rug(ppm)

#| This one-dimensional plot, with its grayscale
#| representation, gives you a little more detailed
#| information about how many data points are in each
#| bucket and where they lie within the bucket. It
#| shows (through density of tick marks) that the
#| greatest concentration of counties has between 9
#| and 12 micrograms per cubic meter just as the
#| histogram did.

#| To illustrate this a little more, we've defined for
#| you two vectors, high and low, containing pollution
#| data of high (greater than 15) and low (less than
#| 5) values respectively. Look at low now and see how
#| it relates to the output of rug.

low
# [1] 3.494351 4.186090 4.917140 4.504539 4.793644
# [6] 4.601408 4.195688 4.625279 4.460193 4.978397
#[11] 4.324736 4.175901 3.382626 4.132739 4.955570
#[16] 4.565808

#| It confirms that there are two data points between
#| 3 and 4 and many between 4 and 5. Now look at high.

high
#[1] 16.19452 15.80378 18.44073 16.66180 15.01573
#[6] 17.42905 16.25190 16.18358

#| Again, we see one data point greater than 18, one
#| between 17 and 18, several between 16 and 17 and
#| two between 15 and 16, verifying what rug
#| indicated.

#| Now rerun hist with 3 arguments, ppm as its first,
#| col equal to "green", and the argument breaks equal
#| to 100.

hist(ppm, col="green", breaks=100)

#| So this histogram with more buckets is not nearly
#| as smooth as the preceding one. In fact, it's a
#| little too noisy to see the distribution clearly.
#| When you're plotting histograms you might have to
#| experiment with the argument breaks to get a good
#| idea of your data's distribution. For fun now,
#| rerun the R command rug with the argument ppm.

rug(ppm)

#| See how rug works with the existing plot? It
#| automatically adjusted its pocket size to that of
#| the last plot plotted.

#...

 # |=====================                       |  49%

#| Now rerun hist with ppm as the data and col equal
#| to "green".

#| Now run the command abline with the argument v
#| equal to 12 and the argument lwd equal to 2.

abline(v=12,lwd=2)

#| See the vertical line at 12? Not very visible, is
#| it, even though you specified a line width of 2?
#| Run abline with the argument v equal to
#| median(ppm), the argument col equal to "magenta",
#| and the argument lwd equal to 4.

abline(v=median(ppm),lwd=4,col="magenta")

#| Better, right? Thicker and more of a contrast in
#| color. This shows that although the median (50%) is
#| below the standard, there are a fair number of
#| counties in the U.S that have pollution levels
#| higher than the standard.

#| Now recall that our pollution data had 5 columns of
#| information. So far we've only looked at the pm25
#| column. We can also look at other information. To
#| remind yourself what's there run the R command
#| names with pollution as the argument.

names(pollution)
#[1] "pm25"      "fips"      "region"    "longitude"
#[5] "latitude"

#| Longitude and latitude don't sound interesting, and
#| each fips is unique since it identifies states
#| (first 2 digits) and counties (last 3 digits).
#| Let's look at the region column to see what's
#| there. Run the R command table on this column. Use
#| the construct pollution$region. Store the result in
#| the variable reg.

reg<-table(pollution$region)
reg

#east west 
# 442  134 

#| Lot more counties in the east than west. We'll use
#| the R command barplot (another type of
#| one-dimensional summary) to plot this information.
#| Call barplot with reg as its first argument, the
#| argument col equal to "wheat", and the argument
#| main equal to the string "Number of Counties in
#| Each Region".

barplot(reg,col="wheat",main="Number of Counties in Each Region")

#| So we've seen several examples of one-dimensional
#| graphs that summarize data. Two dimensional graphs
#| include scatterplots, multiple graphs which we'll
#| see more examples of, and overlayed one-dimensional
#| plots which the R packages such as lattice and
#| ggplot2 provide.

#| Some graphs have more than two-dimensions. These
#| include overlayed or multiple two-dimensional plots
#| and spinning plots. Some three-dimensional plots
#| are tricky to understand so have limited
#| applications. We'll see some examples now of more
#| complicated graphs, in particular, we'll show two
#| graphs together.

#| First we'll show how R, in one line and using base
#| plotting, can display multiple boxplots. We simply
#| specify that we want to see the pollution data as a
#| function of region. We know that our pollution data
#| characterized each of the 576 entries as belonging
#| to one of two regions (east and west).


#| We use the R formula construct y ~ x to show that y
#| (in this case pm25) depends on x (region). Since
#| both come from the same data frame (pollution) we
#| can specify a data argument set equal to pollution.
#| By doing this, we don't have to type pollution$pm25
#| (or ppm) and pollution$region. We can just specify
#| the formula pm25~region. Call boxplot now with this
#| formula as its argument, data equal to pollution,
#| and col equal to "red".

boxplot(pm25 ~ region, data=pollution, col="red")

#| Two for the price of one! Similarly we can plot
#| multiple histograms in one plot, though to do this
#| we have to use more than one R command. First we
#| have to set up the plot window with the R command
#| par which specifies how we want to lay out the
#| plots, say one above the other. We also use par to
#| specify margins, a 4-long vector which indicates
#| the number of lines for the bottom, left, top and
#| right. Type the R command
#| par(mfrow=c(2,1),mar=c(4,4,2,1)) now. Don't expect
#| to see any new result.

par(mfrow=c(2,1),mar=c(4,4,2,1))

#  |==============================              |  68%

#| So we set up the plot window for two rows and one
#| column with the mfrow argument. The mar argument
#| set up the margins. Before we plot the histograms
#| let's explore the R command subset which, not
#| surprisingly, "returns subsets of vectors, matrices
#| or data frames which meet conditions". We'll use
#| subset to pull off the data we want to plot. Call
#| subset now with pollution as its first argument and
#| a boolean expression testing region for equality
#| with the string "east". Put the result in the
#| variable east.

east<-subset(pollution, region=="east")

head(east)
 #      pm25  fips region longitude latitude
#1  9.771185 01003   east -87.74826 30.59278
#2  9.993817 01027   east -85.84286 33.26581
#3 10.688618 01033   east -87.72596 34.73148
#4 11.337424 01049   east -85.79892 34.45913
#5 12.119764 01055   east -86.03212 34.01860
#6 10.827805 01069   east -85.35039 31.18973

#| So east holds more information than we need. We
#| just want to plot a histogram with the pm25
#| portion. Call hist now with the pm25 portion of
#| east as its first argument and col equal to "green"
#| as its second.

hist(east$pm25,col="green")

#| See? The command par told R we were going to have one column with 2 rows,
#| so it placed this histogram in the top position.

#| Now, here's a challenge for you. Plot
#| the histogram of the counties from the
#| west using just one R command. Let the
#| appropriate subset command (with the
#| pm25 portion specified) be the first
#| argument and col (equal to "green") the
#| second.  To cut down on your typing,
#| use the up arrow key to get your last
#| command and replace "east" with the
#| subset command. Make sure the boolean
#| argument checks for equality between
#| region and "west".

hist(subset(pollution,region=="west")$pm25, col = "green")
#DID NOT GET RIGHT used skip()

#| See how R does all the labeling for
#| you? Notice that the titles are
#| different since we used different
#| commands for the two plots. Let's look
#| at some scatter plots now.

#| Scatter plots are two-dimensional plots
#| which show the relationship between two
#| variables, usually x and y. Let's look
#| at a scatterplot showing the
#| relationship between latitude and the
#| pm25 data. We'll use plot, a function
#| from R's base plotting package.

# We've seen that we can use a function
#| call as an argument when calling
#| another function. We'll do this again
#| when we call plot with the arguments
#| latitude and pm25 which are both from
#| our data frame pollution. We'll call
#| plot from inside the R command with
#| which evaluates "an R expression in an
#| environment constructed from data".
#| We'll use pollution as the first
#| argument to with and the call to plot
#| as the second. This allows us to avoid
#| typing "pollution$" before the arguents
#| to plot, so it saves us some typing and
#| adds to your base of R knowledge. Try
#| this now.

with(pollution, plot(latitude, pm25))

#| Note that the first argument is plotted
#| along the x-axis and the second along
#| the y. Now use abline to add a
#| horizontal line at 12. Use two
#| additional arguments, lwd equal to 2
#| and lty also equal to 2. See what
#| happens.

abline(h=12,lwd=2,lty=2)

#| See how lty=2 made the line dashed? Now
#| let's replot the scatterplot. This
#| time, instead of using with, call plot
#| directly with 3 arguments. The first 2
#| are pollution$latitude and ppm. The
#| third argument, col, we'll use to add
#| color and more information to our plot.
#| Set this argument (col) equal to
#| pollution$region and see what happens.

#wrong## plot(pollution$latitude,pollution$ppm,col=pollution$region)
plot(pollution$latitude, ppm, col= pollution$region)

#| We've got two colors on the map to
#| distiguish between counties in the east
#| and those in the west. Can we figure
#| out which color is east and which west?
#| See that the high (greater than 50) and
#| low (less than 25) latitudes are both
#| red. Latitudes indicate distance from
#| the equator, so which half of the U.S.
#| (east or west) has counties at the
#| extreme north and south?

#East

#| As before, use abline to add a
#| horizontal line at 12. Use two
#| additional arguments, lwd equal to 2
#| and lty also equal to 2.

abline(h=12,lwd=2,lty=2)

#| We see many counties are above the
#| healthy standard set by the EPA, but
#| it's hard to tell overall, which
#| region, east or west, is worse.

#| Let's plot two scatterplots
#| distinguished by region.

 # |======================================      |  86%

#| As we did with multiple histograms, we
#| first have to set up the plot window
#| with the R command par. This time,
#| let's plot the scatterplots side by
#| side (one row and two columns). We also
#| need to use different margins. Type the
#| R command par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar =
#| c(5, 4, 2, 1)) now. Don't expect to see
#| any new result.

par(mfrow=c(1,2),mar=c(5,4,2,1))

#| For the first scatterplot, on the left,
#| we'll plot the latitudes and pm25
#| counts from the west. We already pulled
#| out the information for the counties in
#| the east. Let's now get the information
#| for the counties from the west. Create
#| the variable west by using the subset
#| command with pollution as the first
#| argument and the appropriate boolean as
#| the second.

west <- subset(pollution,region=="west")

#| Now call plot with three arguments.
#| These are west$latitude (x-axis),
#| west$pm25 (y-axis), and the argument
#| main equal to the string "West"
#| (title). Do this now.

plot(west$latitude,west$pm25,main="West")

#| For the second scatterplot, on the
#| right, we'll plot the latitudes and
#| pm25 counts from the east.
